According to research \cite{felics} the resulting compressor runs about five times as fast as an implementation of the lossless mode of the JPEG proposed standard while obtaining slightly better compression on many images.

A formal description of the algorithm can be found in \cite{felics}.

Each pixel is assigned a code depending on where its intensity (gray-scale value) is located relative to the intensities of its closest neigbours. The distribution of an image's intensity distribution is shown in \ref{dist}. L denotes the smaller neigbouring intensity value, H denotes the larger neighbouring intensity value. There are three cases:
\enumerate{
    \item The pixel's intensity P lies in the range [L, H]. One bit (0) is used to indicate the in-range position. Since the values of P are almost uniformly distributed, P is assigned an adjusted binary code that is slightly shorter at the center of the region \cite{handbook}.
    \item The pixel's intensity P is lower than L. Now, one bit (1) is used to indicate the out-of-range position, and one bit (0) is used to indicate the below-range position. 
    \item The pixel's intensity P is higher than H. Now, one bit (1) is used to indicate the out-of-range position, and one bit (1) is used to indicate the above-range position. 
}
The probability of out-of-range values falls off sharply, so it is reasonable to use exponential prefix codes like Golomb or Rice codes \cite{felics}.


Felics provides good compression, however, it cannot compress an image to below one bit per pixel, making it a bad choice for highly redundant data \cite{handbook}. the data for this thesis is not redundant.
