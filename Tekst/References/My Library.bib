	abstract = {Fully Adaptive Prediction Error Coder (FAPEC) is a data compressor which offers good compression ratios even when data is severely affected by noise and outliers. This, combined with its high computing performance, makes it suitable for space applications. It is based on a variety of pre-processing stages followed by an outlier-resilient adaptive entropy coder. Sample sizes of 8–24 bits are supported. Pre-processing stages range from simple delta algorithms (with interleaving, lossy, and filtering options) to more complex discrete wavelet transform and Hierarchical Pixel Averaging image algorithms (with or without losses, for single or multiple bands). A quick prediction-based lossless multi-band algorithm is also available, as well as lightweight dictionary-like pattern recognition. Thus, one can have functionalities equivalent to those of Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) 121.0, 122.x, and 123.x in a single system, as well as some features not supported yet by any recommendation. Here, we describe the main features of FAPEC and the results obtained on a variety of data, comparing compression ratios and speeds against CCSDS standards.},

	abstract = {Future space missions are based on a new generation of instruments. These missions find a serious constraint in the telemetry system, which cannot download to ground the large volume of data generated. Hence, data compression algorithms are often mandatory in space, despite the modest processing power usually available on-board. We present here a compact solution implemented in hardware for such missions. FAPEC is a lossless compressor which typically can outperform the CCSDS 121.0 recommendation on realistic data sets. With efficiencies higher than 90\% of the Shannon limit in most cases - even in presence of noise or outliers - FAPEC has been successfully validated in its software version as a robust low-complexity alternative to the recommendation. This work describes the FAPEC implementation on an FPGA, targeting the space-qualified Actel RTAX family. We prove that FAPEC is hardwarefriendly and that it does not require external memory. We also assess the correct operation of the prototype for an initial throughput of 32 Mbits/s with very low power consumption (about 20 mW). Finally, we discuss further potential applications of FAPEC, and we set the basis for the improvements that will boost FAPEC performance beyond the 100 Mbit/s level.},

	abstract = {Lossless compression is often required for downloading data of scientific payloads in space missions. The consultative committee for space data systems (CCSDS) 121.0 recommendation on lossless data compression is a “de-facto” standard, and it has been used in several missions so far owing to the reasonable compression ratios achieved with low processing requirements. Although the Rice coder used by this standard is optimal when dealing with noiseless Laplacian-distributed data, its performance rapidly degrades when noisy data are compressed or when there is a significant fraction of outliers in the input data. An alternative to this is PEC, the Prediction Error Coder, which is the core of the FAPEC adaptive entropy coder. We describe, analyze and test PEC on real and simulated data, revealing its key role in the excellent outlier resiliency of FAPEC. PEC is a fast and noise-resilient semi-adaptive entropy coder that can achieve better performances than the CCSDS standard in the presence of noise or when the input data contains a sizable fraction of outliers, while requiring very low processing resources.},
